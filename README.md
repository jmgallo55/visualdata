# Welcome to Visual Data!

Initial Commit based off of: (https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). 

I am planning on greatly changing this website in the various ways:
1. It must delpoy to a cloud service - currently Microsoft Azure
2. Need to create a database with Azure to store user information
3. The purpose is to create visual graphs for data from Data.Gov. Need to create the framework for this
  a. Need Database working
  b. Need to create Schemas for Info- try to keep the same for each chart
  c. Need to create FE for data
  
 Any help would be appreciated!
